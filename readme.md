# My Notes Site


I have created MyNotes to take notes of various important things and task to do. It has a feature thought which you can you note from the Search bar. Also if you want to delete any note you can simply tap the delete button. It is fully User-friendly site.


This project is made with HMTL, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap. To achieve this, I implemented the following :- 



## HTML Sections and Containers
I used Section tags to create different part of this site and also make Containers using div tag to store different components of this site. 



## CSS Grid & Flexbox 
I created fluid layouts throughout the page with a mixture of Grid and Flexbox.The site is fully responsive on multiple screen widths.



## JavaScript
I created functions to Add Note, Delete Note and Search Note using the concept of Local Storage.

## Bootstrap
I used different bootstrap classes in creating Navbar and card container.
